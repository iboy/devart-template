#Inspiration
The inspiration for this project comes a variety of sources: traditional shadow play  from various puppet theatre traditions (Herta Schonewolf) through to the computer vision and installation work of Myron Krueger, Philip Worthington (ShadowMonsters), Golan Levin, Theo Watson; the performance animation work of Miwa Matreyek; the touchable animations of Jeff Han; the digital puppetry work of LuiÃÅs Leite. Technology, like game physics engines and the animated phenomena they support is also an inspiration.
