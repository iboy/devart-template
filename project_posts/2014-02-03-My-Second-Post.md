Nice image idea from ofZach. The roots of the ShadowEngine arise in my DPhil project and there is a host of material that is informing the work. At there heart is a love of shadow theatre (of all kinds), early computer vision work and interactive installations that employ games, interaction and performance.

I'll post later on the flexibility of the ShadowEngine: one minute you can perform a traditional simulation of Greek Karagiozis, next Turkish Karag√∂z, then experimental shadow theatres, with objects and abstract forms.
