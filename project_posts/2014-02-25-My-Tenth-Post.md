Variations on the Theme

**Sketch 1**

- Some silhouette forms (3 maybe more each swinging gently in light circles / close iris crop).
- When a visitor / puppeteer dwells - the silhouette saturates through greyscale to colour.
- After a further duration of  dwelling, the figure is sent impulses to it's control joints and gets increasingly agitated.

**Sketch 2**

- Like above each silhouette form appears swinging gently in circles / close iris crops).
- Visitor numbers are counted using openTSPS (TSPS a cross platform Toolkit for Sensing People in Spaces) it uses OSC and speaks to Unity.
- Visitor movement / stillness is tracked

**Sketch 3**

- Track visiter held blobs using openTSPS and map the blobs positions onto simplified spring controllers on a set of figures.
- Offset slightly, so one person can control many different (almost dancing) puppets
