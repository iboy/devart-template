#Motivation
With a passion for creating animated phenomena and the illusion of life, my ongoing creative coding project - the ShadowEngine - is motivated by a number of drives and ideas:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- to translate traditional methods of puppetry into creating interactive animated computational media;
- to create participatory performative experiences using a variety of input devices and interactive techniques: one avenue is exploring multitouch control of shadow characters, another hand detection (using the LeapMotion and Kinect);
- the act of co-creation is important: how can puppeteers / participants collaborate to create an animated performance image;
- in the ShadowEngine I have an ongoing coding project making a performance animation toolkit deployable in a few contexts, with minor re-configuration: workshops, performance, installation;
- reconfiguring the ShadowEngine can create a range of animated phenomena, for example: form exploring traditional forms of world shadow theatre to exploring generative graphics to exploring abstract soft-body forms. I'll illustrated these variation in future posts;
- I've evaluated a range of technologies, frameworks and environments (Ogre, OpenSceneGraph, OpenFrameworks, Bullet Physics, Box2D, Unity etc.) to explore physics based interactive animated phenomena, and I'll outline some examples in future posts;
